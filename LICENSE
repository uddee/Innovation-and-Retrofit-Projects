### Notes on Usage:
- The **Automated Testing** function will generate random test results, simulating various aspects such as success rate, system stability, and performance.
- The **Performance Review** function generates a simulated benchmark score for the system and suggests whether it requires optimization.
- The project is designed to be extendable, and you can modify the logic for more specific testing or benchmarking based on your real-world scenarios.

This `README.md` is structured to provide all the necessary information to use, contribute, and understand the **Innovation and Retrofit Projects** code. Make sure to adjust the repository link and system details for your specific case.
